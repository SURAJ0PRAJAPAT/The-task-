Step-by-Step Explanation 

1.Data Preprocessing Handling Missing Values: Checked and confirmed no missing values in the dataset Normalization: Applied StandardScaler to standardize features (crucial for spectral data) Train-Test Split: 80-20 split with stratification to maintain distribution 
2. Spectral Visualization Created average reflectance curve showing characteristic absorption features Identified key spectral regions with high reflectance variability 
3. Dimensionality Reduction PCA retained 95% variance with 35 components (from original 448) 2D visualization shows some clustering by DON concentration
4. Neural Network Architecture 3 hidden layers with dropout regularization (40% and 30%) Model Performance:
MAE: 3451.2347
RMSE: 10049.1264
R²: 0.6387  on test set Training curve shows good convergence without overfitting 
5. XGBoost Baseline Achieved comparable performance( XGBoost Performance:
MAE: 3457.1224
RMSE: 10523.5587
R²: 0.6038)Feature importance analysis identified key wavelength bands 

Key Insights & Improvements
1. Spectral Patterns Strong absorption around bands 50-150 (likely chlorophyll regions) High reflectance in NIR regions (band 200+)
2. Model Performance Both models captured non-linear relationships in data NN slightly outperformed XGBoost due to complex spectral interactions
3. Improvement Opportunities Add spectral derivative features to enhance chemical bonding signatures Implement 1D CNN for better local pattern extraction Add attention mechanisms to focus on critical wavelength regions Experiment with wavelet transforms for multi-scale analysis
